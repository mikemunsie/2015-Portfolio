<p>For very long I have used a routine in which involves a for-loop and going through every element&#39;s value and then selecting the option that matches the value specified. How about we scratch that. How about we make all of this one line of code? 
<pre class="brush:js">
  $(&#39;select[name=SELECTNAME] option[value=VALUE&#39;).attr(&quot;selected&quot;, true);
</pre>
Enjoy! :D</p>
