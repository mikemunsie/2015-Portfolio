<p>Just in case you were wondering, I&#39;ve been working with ADT in the past 7 months on their new customer portal @ <a href="http://myadt.com" target="_blank">http://myadt.com</a>. So far it&#39;s been a pretty neat project! I&#39;ve developed the mobile version of the site (we went responsive), created the new home page slideshow, and have helped create many of the internal pages on the site. I&#39;ve also helped create Wireframes and had the privilege to work along side many talented developers to catch up with some good UX design.</p>

<p>Long story short: I&#39;ve learned quite a lot.</p>

<p>Since being on this project I&#39;ve fallen in love with KnockoutJS, introduced to Wire-framing with Keynote, and of course learning much more about the truly amazing SASS. Also before this project I would use frameworks for creating responsive design such as <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter&#39;s Bootstrap</a> or Zurb&#39;s awesome <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>. Now I just use a classy mixin called <a href="http://thesassway.com/intermediate/responsive-web-design-part-2" target="_blank">respond-to&quot;</a> in which you just a pass a device you want to write queries to and it will go ahead and add those in for you.</p>
